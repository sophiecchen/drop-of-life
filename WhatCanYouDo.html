		<h1 class="font2">What Can You Do?</h1>
		
		<p class="font1">So what can you do to help the clean water crisis? It is quite evident that something needs to be done in order to minimize the effects of the crisis. Even small steps at home can make a difference on a greater scale, especially if communities all work together.</p>

		<h2 class="font2">Everyday Actions</h2>
		
		<p class="font1">Storm water runoff results from water picking up impurities when running across impermeable surfaces. Homeowners can greatly reduce this runoff by using materials with pores, such as gravel or wood, as opposed to concrete or asphalt. Trenches can also be dug to catch storm water from surfaces that must be impermeable, such as driveways. </p>

		<p class="font1">Also, used water can be protected from excess harmful chemicals. Avoiding flushing tampons and baby wipes down the toilet and rinsing oils and chemicals into sinks can reduce the risk of water contamination. Cleaning chemicals should also not be disposed down sinks. Excess medicine should never be able to find its way into the water supply as well. Sink garbage disposals should not be used if possible. These toxins can often be recycled. Communities may have recycling centers that accept household chemicals.</p>

		<p class="font1">Cleaning up pet waste, especially for canines, is also a way to reduce runoff pollution. Doing so can guard valuable water resources from being contaminated with bacteria present in animal waste.</p>
		
		<p class="font1">Likewise, cars are also a source of water pollution. Managing and maintaining vehicles can help reduce the presence of oil and other liquids like antifreeze in water. Maintaining a vehicle will also keep it efficient and less harmful to the environmental in general.</p>

		<div class="what2" role="img" aria-label="A Travis Airman saves water by turning off the faucet when washing his hands."></div>
		
		<p class="font1">Conservation is key. For homeowners with gardens, another way to protect clean water is by limiting pesticide use. Similarly, the use of plastics, which are hard to break down, should be limited. Plastics that often end up in water sources spread decay. Plastic bottles, for example, should be recycled and not left on the beach. Pesticides, as well as fertilizers and herbicides, are harmful to water. Bleaches and detergents should not be used excessively in the dishwasher or washing machine. </p>
		
		<p class="font1">On the other hand, increasing the amount of plants and flowers can reduce runoff. Water pollution would also be greatly reduced if people did not litter. Try to clean up plastics and other litter and dispose of it safely instead. Detergents that do not contain phosphate should be used if possible, as excess phosphate in water supplies can cause nutrient pollution, and by extension, algae blooms.</p>
		
		<p class="font1">Consumers can also show support for water safety through their food choices. Buying sustainable meats is a better choice for Earth’s water supply. Meats from factory farms, on the other hand, come from farms that often produce waste that harm nearby water. Meats in general take large quantities of water to produce. If organic food is affordable and available, then choosing organic can reduce pollution. Such food is grown with few chemicals, reducing the amount of pollutants that make it into the water from its producers.</p>
		
		<p class="font1">Conserving water in general can also minimize water waste. By simply turning off running water when it is not necessary, clean water shortages can hopefully be prevented or delayed. For example, people can choose to turn off the water when brushing their teeth or take showers instead of baths. Installing a water efficient toilet can also reduce water waste. Even putting a brick or half gallon container inside the toilet’s tank can reduce the water used when flushing. Using the dishwasher or washing machine only when it is full also means maximizing the use of clean water, preventing excess waste.</p>
		
		<p class="font1">Home installations, such as a water butt, can also prove useful to homeowners with gardens. The extra water from rain can be used to water plants.</p>

		<p class="font1">To help improve the access rural communities have to clean water, show support to the organizations that are reaching out.</p>
