		<h1 class="font2">International Efforts</h1>
		
		<p class="font1">The most obvious solution to the water crisis is found in charity-like work. By working abroad, organizations and other governmental agencies can often help communities in developing countries increase their quality of life. Though projects such as these may not always be the most sustainable, it is important to know that by involving the citizens of the developing place and giving villages necessary resources for life, a region can thrive and receive the economic boost it needs to advance further.</p>
		
		<p class="font1">The improvement of water infrastructure is often too expensive for communities who have low access rates. A solution to this is the installation of a decentralized water distribution system. Such systems include the construction of rain collection, water recycling, well, and pump systems. Though these projects are often much cheaper for small communities, the best way to support water access efforts is through donations and volunteers from organizations or agencies.</p>

	    <h2 class="font2">Instances of Outreach</h2>

		<p class="font1">For example, the Malawi Social Action Fund has been working with regional governments since around 2002. NGOs, or nongovernmental organizations, trained community members to operate facilities after receiving funds from agencies such as the World Bank. The facilities were paid for through local funds and other forms of aid.</p>

		<p class="font1">Wells with clean water and improved sanitation facilities have also been installed as a part of the Feed the Children under Tiwalere project. </p>
		
		<div class="international" role="img" aria-label="A Malawi child drinks clean water from a borehole installed because of the Feed the Children under Tiwalere project."></div>
		
		<p class="font1">Likewise, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention Haiti has supported water and sanitation technicians, or TEPACs. By training and implementing workers, 133 communities were provided with water monitoring and inventory. TEPACs also monitored chlorine levels in the water. Chlorine is safe to consume in water in small amounts, but too much can be poisonous. They helped southern Haiti back on its feet after Hurricane Matthew in the October of 2016.</p>
		
		<p class="font1">As a protection against cholera, the CDC has also created a household water treatment and storage program, or HWTS. Collaborative efforts resulted in the availability of Aquajif, which disinfects chlorine.</p>

		<p class="font1">Haiti has also seen the World Bank, partnered with the State and Peace-Building Fund, or SPF, and the Haitian National Water and Sanitation Directorate, or DINEPA, to bring water supply operators to the communities. Through clean water promotion, the World Bank encouraged Haitians to build their own sanitation facilities, such as toilets. This specific project reached over seven thousand students in thirteen different schools for improved sanitation, as well as fifty thousand people through drinking water systems.</p>
		
		<p class="font1">Furthermore, governmental agencies of international countries like the US and the UK have also stepped in to increase clean water access and improve sanitation. The UN also has a special organization called UN Water, designated specifically to coordinate UN efforts to increase access to clean water. The organization informs, monitors and reports progress, and coordinate awareness observances like World Water Day.</p>

		<h2 class="font2">For Future Programs</h2>

		<p class="font1">Despite continuous efforts to help increase access in developing countries, the United States Agency for International Development found somewhat disheartening results when checking back in on the effects of Millenium Water Alliance-Ethiopia Program, which lasted from 2004 to 2009. In short, the program worked in the short term, but communities struggled to raise money, take leadership, or convince citizens to change their previous behavioral habits. The overall evaluation came with these few key recommendations to future programs:</p>
		
		<ol class="font1 article_list">
		  <li>Allow government entities to play a stronger role in overseeing facility management.</li>
		  <li>See if there are alternative ways to manage services within the community.</li>
		  <li>Take into consideration all of the costs necessary to sustain water infrastructure.</li>
		  <li>Thoroughly analyze needs and sources.</li>
		</ol>

		<p class="font1">Essentially, the most effective means for the everyday citizen to contribute is through raising awareness of the water crisis and through supporting the organizations, agencies, and people who have the means to directly reach others.</p>
